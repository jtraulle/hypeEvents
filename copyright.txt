PHILOSOPHY

In the last year of being an active member of Elgg community, I have noticed that many Elgg site owners are in a need of plugins and features that are similar in their nature.

It is my observation that most plugins within Elgg community have a narrow approach, trying to solve only a certain aspect of the problem in point. This led me to believe that a new approach is required.

With hypeJunction I hope to create a wide set of plugins that address a problem as a whole and can be used within any site despite site specifics and project requirements. The main distinction of hypeJunction plugins is that they are universal in nature, yet allow for easy project-specific customizations.

hypeJunctions is also trying to address the problem of lacking funding within a GPL community, of which Elgg is no exception. Plugin development costs are rather high and not many can afford building a plugin from scratch. In hypeJunction Club, the cost is distributed amongs all members, thus making it interesting and affordable for them to acquire new features that would otherwise be inaccessible.

Membership fees helps fund ground-up development of plugins that are in demand within the Elgg Community. hypeJunction plugins tend to group similar features and wrap them in a package thatâ€™s easy to install, modify and use.



FUTURE

In the near future the hypeJunction Club will feature such plugins as:
- hypeCategories
- hypeGallery
- hypeForum
- hypeEvents
- hypePaidServices
- hypeLearning
- hypeAnalytics
and others
